"but dr. hanover, we re not talking about god, here. we re talking about a very haman dr. robert kohen who

came up with these postulates and were also talking about gigantic changes in medical procedures, medical technology, research capabilities wow t you admit thet koch postulates are not the last word these days in determining cousality?" "no, i wow tadmit that,m.crowley, in fact, i think it's pretty arrogant to even suggest that koch s postulates not only make a lot of common sense, but they also work, as well today as they did 100 I don't know that i agree with you on that point, but id be happy to listen while de gailo tell me what he wants to take the piece of koch's postulates, because we have to have it is totally obvious from all the research that hiv causes aids ked you been on this job back then you would have throw all that evidence out if it didet meet one of koch's postulates? you would have deprived so many thousands of people from treatment over the last twenty-five years because you would refuse acknowledge cause of kids, mr. traniey. ive heard a lot about it, beut i ve never seen that research or that evidence aii i wsaging is that if you throw out koch s postulates, what are we left with cowboy, one time they wanted, could stand up, for example" and she ogain looks directly at dr. gaiio ot the defense has passed and disappeared out the door she then bucks the bit of remaining oncoming traffic, trying to make her way to the front of the courtroom, hoping to speak with benjamin messick os she approches the reii separating the spectators from the attorneys end trial participants she has to pass the defense tabie where crawley and others of his behind jumps to his defense i was foia she wes someone wast have gotten to her" he turned to one of his assistant standing on the outside of the grouge call the cat and make sure she doesnt have job come monday." with the, soap decide she wants to hear more and pauses pretending to be searching for youn.

"E still don't understand why you didn t cross-examine wore witnesses crowley can't let go of his feud with gallo at the moment, so its not the best time ignore the witnesses talking about koch's postulates how would it look if i said that it didn t metter if kir doesn t meet toch postulates, and then get up and argued with a witness who was saying

years ago. if you can show me something better, please do what would you like to replace them with me crawley?" "wwii, i m not the scientific expert here, but if 64.gallo who is a world-recognised expert in his field suggests that koch s postulates we archaic, then i sure ke knows what he s taiking oboat." "well, I don't know that i agree with you on that point, but id be happy to listen while de gailo tell me what he wants to take the piece of koch's postulates, because we have to have some criterio, mr. crawley. wre hare to have something that gives us a system to determine causality. and i haven found anything better thon koch y postuiotes, to this dag." "so, dr. hanover, you re seying thoteven though it is totally obvious from all the research that hiv causes aids ked you been on this job back then you would have throw all that evidence out if it didet meet one of koch's postulates? you would have deprived so many thousands of people from treatment over the last twenty-five years because you would refuse acknowledge the role of his simply because of some set of arbitrary rules from one-hundred years ago from the dark ages of medical research i'm not sure what research or evidence you re speaking of to support him as the cause of kids, mr. traniey. ive heard a lot about it, beut i ve never seen that research or that evidence aii i wsaging is that if you throw out koch s postulates, what are we left with cowboy, one time they wanted, could stand up, for example" and she ogain looks directly at dr. gaiio ot the defense table, "at a press conference, and sey that this virus caused thot discose, and no one would be able to question, it or test to prove it. medicine would be in choos, mr. crawley, choos" crawley decidles to give up.
